# Acknowledgments

This project makes use of several open source projects and contributions. We would like to express our gratitude to the following projects and their contributors:

- [facebook/fresco](https://github.com/facebook/fresco)
  - The Android logging implementation in our project was inspired by it, ensure standard implementation.
- [open-source-parsers/JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/tree/0.10.4)
  - We utilized JsonCpp for parsing and manipulating JSON data within our application. This library significantly simplified the process of JSON handling, allowing us to efficiently convert, store, and retrieve data in JSON format, which enhanced the interoperability and flexibility of our data management systems.
- [bzflag](https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag)
  - We have adapted the MD5 implementation originally developed by Colin Plumb to generate signatures for data transmission in our project. This adaptation ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data exchanged between different components of our system, enhancing security and reliability.
- [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
  - We have utilized Google Test for unit testing in our project. This framework has been instrumental in our development process, allowing us to write and execute comprehensive tests to verify the correctness and robustness of our codebase.
- [WeexSDK](https://github.com/alibaba/weex)
  - Mainly used to handle jni call related operations, making the whole process more standardized and concise.
- [node-usbmux](https://github.com/demille/node-usbmux)
  - We utilize this library to handle USB connections with iOS devices. It provides a robust and efficient framework for communicating with iOS devices over USB, simplifying the complexities involved in USB communication protocols. The library's functionality is crucial for our project's ability to interact seamlessly with iOS hardware, enabling reliable data transfer and device management.

To all the maintainers, contributors, and supporters of the open source libraries we use: your hard work and dedication do not go unnoticed. You have our sincere thanks for not only sharing your code but also your expertise and passion. Your contributions have not only aided our project but have also contributed to the betterment of the technology community at large.

We pledge to support and contribute back to this wonderful community that has given us so much. Thank you for being such an integral part of our journey.
